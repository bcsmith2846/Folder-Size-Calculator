Simple script to recursively calculate the size of all files in a list of directories. I use it to find folders that are taking up a lot of space (looking at you C:\..\AppData\)

Change the `start` variable to choose which folder to scan.

There is an if statement on line 9 that is the minimum folder size (in GB).
